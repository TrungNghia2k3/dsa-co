The base cases handle the scenarios where one of the lists is empty, in which case the other list is returned directly. In the recursive step, the function compares the data of the current nodes of both lists and attaches the smaller node to the merged list. The function then recursively merges the remaining part of the list. This process continues until both lists are fully merged. This approach eliminates the need for extra space and efficiently merges the lists."}
