They work by trying out different paths and if one doesn't work, they backtrack and try another until they find the right one. It's like solving a puzzle by testing different pieces until they fit together perfectly."} />

When a dead end is reached, the algorithm backtracks to the previous decision point and explores a different path until a solution is found or all possibilities have been exhausted."} />

If an extension does not lead to a solution, the algorithm backtracks to the previous solution and tries a different extension."} />
